## 🤔 FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

### Q1: Is this project too ambitious for 5 months?
**A:** No. This is a realistic MVP:
- Academic core (2 weeks)
- Communication (2 weeks)
- Navigation (2 weeks)
- Advanced features (1-2 weeks)
- Testing/Deployment (2 weeks)
With 4 team members, it's achievable. Just stay focused on MVP.

### Q2: Do we need to create 3D models ourselves?
**A:** No, you have options:
- Hire 3D artist (₹20k, 2 weeks)
- Use photogrammetry (₹5k, 1 week)
- Use pre-made models (free, 2 days)
- Start without 3D, add later

### Q3: What if we can't complete everything?
**A:** Focus on MVP, not nice-to-haves:
**Must Have:** Assignments, grades, messaging
**Should Have:** 3D maps, AR navigation
**Nice to Have:** Advanced analytics, social features

Prioritize in this order. Guide will understand time constraints.

### Q4: How much code do we need to write?
**A:** Roughly:
- Backend: 3000-5000 lines
- Frontend: 4000-6000 lines
- Total: ~8000-10000 lines for MVP
(Well-organized, not spaghetti code)

### Q5: Can we use existing libraries/templates?
**A:** YES! Absolutely encouraged:
- Use UI component libraries (Material-UI, Bootstrap)
- Use authentication libraries (Passport.js)
- Use existing 3D models
- Use managed services (Firebase, AWS)
What matters is YOUR integration and customization, not building from scratch.

### Q6: What if we get stuck?
**A:** In order:
1. Check documentation/tutorials
2. Ask team members
3. Check Stack Overflow
4. Ask guide on Friday meeting
Never let blockers slow you down - pivot, ask for help, keep moving.
